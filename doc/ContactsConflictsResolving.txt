	Contact Conflicts Resolving
	===========================

	All contacts are identified by its Id in its container sync source
	but in all scope of contacts they are determined by its FullName in
	any given Name Notation. The sync process starts and fetches two lists
	of contacts from two sources. Then we have core sources that are presented
	as in local as in remote source and tails sets that are presented
	only in its sync sources. That core set is a conflict set. Tails just
	added from one to another.

	There are 3 possible event for managing two equals contacts
	
		o	contacts are equals and no need to be updated

		o	one contact in newer that another, and another
			didn't changed since last sync. Then delete old
			contact and create new one from newer

		o	two contacts was modified since last sync,
			then merge them and update both sources
