	Names Notation and Name Inconsistance Resolution
	================================================

	To simplify contact managing application supports Two Main
	NameNotations: Formal Notation and Human Notation.

	Here is possible name values for Formal Notation:
	
		- Last First Middle
		- Last First
		- First

	And for Human Notation:
	
		- First Middle Last
		- First Middle
		- First
	
	This notation are used to identify contacts in conflict resolution
	in different sources, where Ids comparing are impossible.

	Full Name is just a current view of name information save in given
	profile. It is cached calculated value of function of three
	arguments: First Middle and Last name. If FullName is not specified it is
	calculated from these three fields. If sync source (e.g. GMAIL) does not
	support granural name fields but only FullName then name fields are generated
	with following rules: Full name divides into word pars, and these word
	are placed in approriative positin within profile notation.

	Example of contact fetched in profile with Formal Notation:

	"Turing Alan Mathison" -> Last First Middle
	"Turing Alan" -> Last First
	"Alan Mathison" -> Last First (seems like his father's name)

	All singleword names are placed in FirstName, e.g. "Gerge", "Peter", "Taxi".
